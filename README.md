## Features

- **Interactive Graph Creation**: Click to add nodes, click-and-drag between nodes to create edges
- **Multiple Graph Types**: Support for weighted/unweighted and directed/undirected graphs
- **Algorithm Visualization**:
  - **Shortest Path**: Find and visualize the shortest path between two nodes using BFS
  - **Connected Components**: Identify connected components in your graph
  - **Topological Sort**: Perform and visualize topological sorting of directed acyclic graphs
- **Step-by-step Visualization**: Watch algorithms execute one step at a time
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Detailed information about each step in the algorithm's execution
- **Playback Controls**: Pause, resume, and manually step through the visualization
